    Pull Request (PR)

    How do you create PR ? Can you tell me your PR process ?

            1 : I crweate my branch in GitHub
    2 : I do all my task in there
    3 : I go to GitHub and Create a PR for Main branch and assign to my manager/co-worker
    4 : After my manager reviewed he merged and delete my branch


    What is diffrence between git fetch and git pull ?

    git pull -- will pull and merge (auto Merging)

    git fetch -- will pull but not merge, We need to explicitly ask to merge( git merge) */
